For this project, I obtained the ocean data from OOI website, and chose Cabled Axial Seamount Axial Base Deep and Shallow Profiler Mooring for both winter and summer on the same day. I selected Jan 6-7, 2020 for winter and July 6-7, 2019 for summer. 
There were nine dives in a span of 24 hours in the winter and summer when the device traveled shallow depth as shown in figure 1 and 2, and the average speed of sound profile was approximately 1,484 m/s. However, when the device traveled deeper, as illustrated in figure 3 and 4 , the number of dives went down to 2 dives in both winter and summer, and the average speed of sound profile was about 1,484 m/s, which was similar to its counterpart.
The data explicitly shows that the number of dives per day was considerably higher when the device travels deeper, regardless of seasons. According to the data, the maximum speed of the sound was 1508m/s and 1493m/s in the summer and winter respectively, when the travel depth was shallow; and the maximum speed of the sound was 1499m/s for both summer and winter, when the travel depth was deep. The maximum speed of sound profile was slightly higher in the summer because the temperature of the water increases and aids the sound wave vibration to transfer faster in the water molecules.
The average speed of sound was 1,484.6 m/s for all profilers at the same day in winter and summer with different depths at Cabled Axial Seamount Axial Base. During day time, the speed of the sound profile in all profilers increased because the temperature is higher at day time, which enables the sound wave to travel faster.
